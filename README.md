## What is Lambdify?
The main goal of this project is provide an easy environment to create serverless applications through the AWS Lambda API.



## Documentation
A well writen documentation wasn't finished yet. But you can get some inspirations at the sample
AWS project available at the `samples` directory.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with Lambdify is using the simplified project structure. [Here](https://github.com/lambdify/lambdify/releases/download/0.2.0.Final/aws-apigateway-kotlin-simplified.zip) you can download a ZIP file with a pre-configured project in which you can easily adapt for your needs.
